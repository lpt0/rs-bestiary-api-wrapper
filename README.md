# rs-bestiary-api-wrapper

A wrapper around the [RuneScape Bestiary API](https://runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape_Bestiary).

This was written as practice for writing TypeScript libraries, writing unit tests, and packaging and publishing packages using GitHub Actions.

The key feature of this wrapper is that it has 0 non-dev dependencies (the only dev dependency are the types for Node.js).
